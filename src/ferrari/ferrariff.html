It is Ferrari's first production four-wheel drive model. The body style has been described as a shooting brake, a type of two-door coup√©-based sporting estate. The FF has a top speed of 335 km/h (208 mph) and it accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.7 seconds. Ferrari states that the FF was the world's fastest four-seat automobile upon its release to the public. The FF costs US$300,000, with 800 being produced during the first year.</span></div>
